## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Deny log on as a service user right on domain-joined member servers must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts. No other groups or accounts must be assigned this right.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on as a service" user right defines accounts that are denied logon as a service.

In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.

Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in a denial of service.
