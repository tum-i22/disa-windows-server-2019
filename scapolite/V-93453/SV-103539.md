## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must restrict unauthenticated Remote Procedure Call (RPC) clients from connecting to the RPC server on domain-joined member servers and standalone systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Unauthenticated RPC clients may allow anonymous access to sensitive information. Configuring RPC to restrict unauthenticated RPC clients from connecting to the RPC server will prevent anonymous connections.

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Remote Procedure Call >> "Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients" to "Enabled" with "Authenticated" selected.
