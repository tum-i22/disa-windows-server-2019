## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service must not store RunAs credentials.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Storage of administrative credentials could allow unauthorized access. Disallowing the storage of RunAs credentials for Windows Remote Management will prevent them from being used with plug-ins.
