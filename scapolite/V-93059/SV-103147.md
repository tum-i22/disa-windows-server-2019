## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Create global objects user right must only be assigned to Administrators, Service, Local Service, and Network Service.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Create global objects" user right can create objects that are available to all sessions, which could affect processes in other users' sessions.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}
