## /rule

Windows Server 2019 User Account Control must, at a minimum, prompt administrators for consent on the secure desktop.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures the elevation requirements for logged-on administrators to complete a task that requires raised privileges.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode" to "Prompt for consent on the secure desktop".

The more secure option for this setting, "Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop", would also be acceptable.
