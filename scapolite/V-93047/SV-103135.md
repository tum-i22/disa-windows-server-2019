## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation user right must not be assigned to any groups or accounts on domain-joined member servers and standalone systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" user right allows the "Trusted for Delegation" setting to be changed. This could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users.
