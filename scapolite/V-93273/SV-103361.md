## /rule

Windows Server 2019 domain controllers must be configured to allow reset of machine account passwords.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Enabling this setting on all domain controllers in a domain prevents domain members from changing their computer account passwords. If these passwords are weak or compromised, the inability to change them may leave these computers vulnerable.

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Domain controller: Refuse machine account password changes" to "Disabled".
