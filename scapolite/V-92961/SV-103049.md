## /rule

Windows Server 2019 machine inactivity limit must be set to 15 minutes or less, locking the system with the screen saver.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and should be locked when unattended. The screen saver should be set at a maximum of 15 minutes and be password protected. This protects critical and sensitive data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000028-GPOS-00009, SRG-OS-000029-GPOS-00010, SRG-OS-000031-GPOS-00012
