## /rule

Windows Server 2019 maximum age for machine account passwords must be configured to 30 days or less.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Computer account passwords are changed automatically on a regular basis. This setting controls the maximum password age that a machine account may have. This must be set to no more than 30 days, ensuring the machine changes its password monthly.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

This is the default configuration for this setting (30 days).

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Domain member: Maximum machine account password age" to "30" or less (excluding "0", which is unacceptable).
