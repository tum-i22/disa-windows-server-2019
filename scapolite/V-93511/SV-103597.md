## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must be configured to use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

This setting ensures the system uses algorithms that are FIPS-compliant for encryption, hashing, and signing. FIPS-compliant algorithms meet specific standards established by the U.S. Government and must be the algorithms used for all OS encryption functions.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing" to "Enabled".
