## /rule

Windows Server 2019 User Account Control (UAC) must only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

UAC is a security mechanism for limiting the elevation of privileges, including administrative accounts, unless authorized. This setting configures Windows to only allow applications installed in a secure location on the file system, such as the Program Files or the Windows\System32 folders, to run with elevated privileges.
