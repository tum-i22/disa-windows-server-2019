## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must be configured to enable Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

An exportable version of credentials is provided to remote hosts when using credential delegation which exposes them to theft on the remote host.  Restricted Admin mode or Remote Credential Guard allow delegation of non-exportable credentials providing additional protection of the credentials.  Enabling this configures the host to support Restricted Admin mode or Remote Credential Guard.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Credentials Delegation >> "Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials" to "Enabled".
