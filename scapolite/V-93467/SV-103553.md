## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must be configured to prevent the storage of the LAN Manager hash of passwords.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The LAN Manager hash uses a weak encryption algorithm and there are several tools available that use this hash to retrieve account passwords. This setting controls whether a LAN Manager hash of the password is stored in the SAM the next time the password is changed.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change" to "Enabled".
