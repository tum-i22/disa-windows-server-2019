## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must have software certificate installation files removed.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Use of software certificates and their accompanying installation files for end users to access resources is less secure than the use of hardware-based certificates.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Remove any certificate installation files (*.p12 and *.pfx) found on a system.

Note: This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for .p12 certificate files or Adobe PreFlight certificate files.
