## /rule

Windows Server 2019 must not the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol installed.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

SMBv1 is a legacy protocol that uses the MD5 algorithm as part of SMB. MD5 is known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks such as collision and preimage attacks and is not FIPS compliant.

false

## /implementations/0/description

Uninstall the SMBv1 protocol.

Open "Windows PowerShell" with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

Enter "Uninstall-WindowsFeature -Name FS-SMB1 -Restart".
(Omit the Restart parameter if an immediate restart of the system cannot be done.)

Alternately:

Start "Server Manager".

Select the server with the feature.

Scroll down to "ROLES AND FEATURES" in the right pane.

Select "Remove Roles and Features" from the drop-down "TASKS" list.

Select the appropriate server on the "Server Selection" page and click "Next".

Deselect "SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support" on the "Features" page.

Click "Next" and "Remove" as prompted.
