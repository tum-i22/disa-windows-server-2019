## /rule

Windows Server 2019 built-in guest account must be renamed.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The built-in guest account is a well-known user account on all Windows systems and, as initially installed, does not require a password. This can allow access to system resources by unauthorized users. Renaming this account to an unidentified name improves the protection of this account and the system.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Accounts: Rename guest account" to a name other than "Guest".
