## /rule

Windows Server 2019 hardened Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths must be defined to require mutual authentication and integrity for at least the \\*\SYSVOL and \\*\NETLOGON shares.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Additional security requirements are applied to UNC paths specified in hardened UNC paths before allowing access to them. This aids in preventing tampering with or spoofing of connections to these paths.
