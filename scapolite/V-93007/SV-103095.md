## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Access this computer from the network user right must only be assigned to the Administrators and Authenticated Users groups on domain-joined member servers and standalone systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Access this computer from the network" user right may access resources on the system, and this right must be limited to those requiring it.
