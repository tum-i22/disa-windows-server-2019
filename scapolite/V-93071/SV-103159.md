## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Impersonate a client after authentication user right must only be assigned to Administrators, Service, Local Service, and Network Service.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Impersonate a client after authentication" user right allows a program to impersonate another user or account to run on their behalf. An attacker could use this to elevate privileges.
