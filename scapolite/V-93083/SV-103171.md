## /rule

Windows Server 2019 Profile single process user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Profile single process" user right can monitor non-system processes performance. An attacker could use this to identify processes to attack.
