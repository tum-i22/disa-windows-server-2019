# DISA Windows Server 2019 STIG Evaluation

This repository is part of the paper *Automated Implementation of Windows-related Security-Configuration Guides* presented at the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering.
We conducted all the steps described in our article additionally on the [DISA Windows Server 2019 STIG benchmark](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_MS_Windows_Server_2016_V1R13_STIG_SCAP_1-2_Benchmark.zip) to demonstrate that our approach is feasible on recent security-configuration guides.

The benchmark itself is property of the DISA but [may be distributed or copied](https://public.cyber.mil/privacy-security/).
The rest of this repository is under GPL-3.0.
